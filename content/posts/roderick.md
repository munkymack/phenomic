Let's talk a little bit about an absolutely fantastic band, [The Long Winters](www.thelongwinters.com).

Formed in the early 2000s by John Roderick, The Long Winters arose from the ashes of Roderick's former band, Western State Hurricanes. Roderick enlisted his former tour-mate Sean Nelson, lead singer of Harvey Danger, to join the band on keyboards (Roderick had been a touring guitarist with the band).

Roderick has a number of outlets, creative and otherwise, apart from the band. He often writes for Seattle alt-weekly ["The Stranger"](www.thestranger.com), co-hosts two beloved podcasts, [Roderick On The Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/) and [Road Work](http://5by5.tv/roadwork), and recently stood as a candidate for Seattle's city council.

Roderick's preferred method of conveyance is [astride a bear, wearing a bathrobe and wielding a scimitar](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-70-bad-cop-worse-cop-man-in-bathrobe.html).
